# PROGRAM (Answer):

#python
def LCM(a,b,i):       #Works even if (a>b) or (b>a)
    if (a*i) % b==0:  #Checking whether the multiples of 'a' is divisible by 'b' or not
        print(a*i)
    else:
        LCM(a,b,i+1)
n1 = int(input())
n2 = int(input())
LCM(n1,n2,i=1)     # i is taken initially as 1
