QUESTION:

Write a python program takes a number and finds the binary equivalent of a number recursively.

Input & Output Format:
Input consists of one integer.
Output consists of a binary number.

Sample Input:
5

Sample Output:
1 0 1

'''

# PROGRAM (Answer):

# 1st Method
def bi(a):
    if a>1:
        bi(a//2)
    print(a%2,end='')    #Tail Recursion Technique

n = int(input())        
bi(n)

'''
To stack the remainders in bottom-up manner,
we use the technique of the tail recursion 
i.e., print remainders after the recursive call.

'''

# # 2nd Method 
# def binary(bi,p,n):
#     if n>0:
#         bi=((n%2)*(10**p)) + bi
#         binary(bi,p+1,n//2)
#     else:
#         print(bi) 
        
# n = int(input())
# binary(0,0,n)
